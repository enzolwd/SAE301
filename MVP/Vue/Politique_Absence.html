        <h1>Absence Policy</h1>

        <h3>Article 1: Procedure for Justifying Short Absences</h3>
        <p>1.1. Notification deadline: Any absence, regardless of duration, must be reported to the project supervisor as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>1.2. Submission of proof: To officially justify an absence (e.g., medical certificate, administrative summons, etc.), the student has 48 hours (working days) following their return to submit the supporting document to the supervisor.</p>
        <p>1.3. Unjustified absence: Any absence not justified according to procedure 1.2 will be counted in the penalty calculation (see Article 3).</p>

        <h3>Article 2: Management of Long Absences (Exceeding one week)</h3>
        <p>2.1. Prior notification: For any foreseeable absence lasting longer than one (1) consecutive week, the student is required to inform the project supervisor beforehand, as soon as the date of absence is known.</p>
        <p>2.2. Project continuity: This prior notification aims to allow for work reorganization and ensure project continuity. The student remains required to provide official proof according to the procedure in Article 1.</p>

        <h3>Article 3: Impact of Unjustified Absences on Assessment</h3>
        <p>Attendance is an essential component of assessment. Duly justified absences (according to Articles 1 and 2) do not result in any penalty. However, unjustified absences will impact the final grade according to the following scale:</p>
        <p>3.1. Tolerance: From 1 to 4 unjustified absences (cumulative over the duration of the project), no penalty is applied to the averages.</p>
        <p>3.2. Penalty application: Starting from the 5th unjustified absence, a penalty of -0.5 points will be applied to all skill averages evaluated within the project scope.</p>
        <p>3.3. Incremental penalty: For each additional unjustified absence beyond the 5th, the penalty is increased by -0.1 points.</p>
